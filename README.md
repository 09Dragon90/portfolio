## 🌟 About this project

This is my personal **portfolio website**, built with **Angular** and **SCSS**, where I showcase selected web development projects, technologies, and contact options.  
It acts as a central hub to demonstrate my frontend skills and provide access to live demos and GitHub repositories.

The portfolio includes:
